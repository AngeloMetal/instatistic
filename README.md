This software promises you useful and deep statistical information from your instagram account.

# How does it work:
1) Request to download all of your data from instagram.com/download/request.
2) Once you do it, write your username in the software click to start.
3) You extract the messages.json file from one of the zip files.
4) You import it on instatistic and voila! Here you go.

*(At the moment only messages' statistics can be analyzed)*
